The following is a good example of a commit message.

```text
feat(angularjs): Add flipper-open directive for AngularJS.

The flipper-open directive does the following:

- Creates / inits the flipper.
- Automatically binds the open click event to `$element`.
- Destroys the flipper when the `$scope` is destroyed.

BREAKING CHANGE: The flipper-open directive replaces the old fliper-open directive.

Related to #123, TP #321. Closes #456.
